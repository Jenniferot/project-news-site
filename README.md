# News Site

This project was to create a news site. My idea was a food news site called Green Menu. The site would have news and recipes for vegan food. A daily menu will be published every day.


## The problem

First I made a sketch of how it would look. I used flexbox to make it responsive. If I had more time I would make hover on the links. Maybe change the header, put in a proper logo and make the links work.

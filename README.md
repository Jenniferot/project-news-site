# News Site

I have created a news site called Green Menu. On this site there will be news and recipes about vegan food. And todays menu will be published every day.


## The problem

First I made a sketch of how it would look. I used flexbox to make it responsive. If I had more time I would make hover on the links. Maybe change the header, put in a proper logo and make the links work. 

Next time I will plan the responsive effects earlier, already when I make the sketch. 

I had problems with almost everything... Most with the big news section before it started to show up in a row. Depending on all levels of sections/divs.

This will be deployed on Netlify.
